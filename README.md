My Java studies

Basic Console Java applications that covers a lot of content since primitive variables, Arrays, Collections, Object Oriented Programming(Polimorphism, Inheritence, Encapsulation, etc) Inner Classes, Generics, Exception Handling, and much more. Just import into Eclipse IDE and have fun!
